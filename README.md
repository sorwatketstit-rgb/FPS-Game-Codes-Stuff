# FPS-Movement-with-momentum
A code for fps movement with momentum, wall running, and sliding. (I did not write by myself but let AI wrote it for me, I just give instructions on how to write it.)

WASD to move.
Shift to slide.
Space to jump.
Wall run is a big buggy.

Feel free to use this code for any of your projects.
